            <h2>Hello! My name is Ryan Andrews </h2>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;I am the creator of “How to: Live Pain Free.” I was introduced to the world of physical therapy back in 2020 after I had an ankle / knee injury from running, but it wasn’t until late 2021 that I grew tired of the repetitive injuries that followed and dove head first into understanding why I was in pain and how to live pain free again. Injury should not be a norm with exercise, and that is what I seek to change.</p>
