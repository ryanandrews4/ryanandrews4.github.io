            <p><i><strong>&emsp;&emsp;Why you are in pain is relative to the activities you perform in your daily life, BUT generally speaking all pains can be summed up into (4) general categories. It is my hope you will read through them to determine which relates most to your case and then following the recommended solution!</strong></i></p>
            <hr>
            <h3>1)  <u>Dull Aches</u>: In age or sedentary lifestyles.</h2>
            <p><u>Causation:</u> Pain is often caused from weak muscles with limited ranges of motion.</p>
            <p><u>Solution:</u> See the <a href="./MobilityPage.html">Mobility section</a> - A full body Mobility routine would solve your pain here by developing a larger range of motion and building up strength throughout its entirety.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>2)  <u>Joint Pain</u>: In avid lifters or athletes.</h2>
            <p><u>Causation:</u> Pain is often caused by muscular imbalance.</p>
            <p><u>Solution:</u> See the <a href="./MuscleIsolationPage.html">Muscle Isolation</a> section - Understanding what muscles you use in your current workouts is step one. Step two is finding the antagonizing muscles and performing Muscle Isolation work to bring balance the joint.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>3)  <u>Pulled or Strained Muscle</u>:  (AKA Tendonitis)</h2>
            <p><u>Causation:</u> This injury occurs when the muscle is overworked without adequate stretching in-between workouts. </p>
            <p><u>Solution:</u>See the <a href="./StretchingPage.html">Stretching</a> section - Pain is prevented by following your workouts with appropriate and effective stretches.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>4)  <u>Torn Muscles</u>:</h2>
            <p><u>Causation:</u> This injury occurs when proper warm ups are not implemented.</p>
            <p><u>Solution:</u> See the <a href="./WarmUpsPage.html">Warm-Ups</a> section - Pain is prevented when appropriate warm ups are done prior to rigorous exercise.</p>
